# Background and Context: AR-Enabled Urban Planning and Building Energy Management

## Theoretical Framework: Digital Transformation in Spatial Planning

Contemporary urban planning theory is experiencing a paradigmatic shift toward digital planning or planning support systems (PSS), characterized by the systematic integration of computational technologies into traditional planning methodologies (Awang et al., 2020; Reinwald et al., 2014). This transformation aligns with broader theoretical frameworks in human-computer interaction (HCI) and spatial cognition, particularly the concept of "embodied interaction" where physical and digital spaces converge to create new forms of spatial understanding and decision-making processes.

Within this theoretical context, Augmented Reality (AR) emerges as a critical technology that operationalizes the concept of "hybrid space" - environments where digital information is spatially registered and contextually integrated with physical reality (Williams et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Unlike traditional Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that abstract spatial relationships through map-based interfaces, AR enables direct spatial manipulation, where users can engage with urban models through natural, intuitive gestures within three-dimensional space (Batty, 2013). This capability fundamentally alters the epistemological basis of planning practice, shifting from representation-based analysis toward experiential, embodied understanding of spatial relationships and urban dynamics.

## Institutional Context and Standards Compliance Framework

While these theoretical developments suggest transformative possibilities for planning practice, the implementation of AR technologies within institutional contexts reveals significant tensions between technological capabilities and organizational requirements. Organizations such as die STEG (Stadtentwicklung GmbH) in Germany operate within complex regulatory frameworks that mandate compliance with European spatial data infrastructure directives (INSPIRE), national geodata access laws (Geodatenzugangsgesetz), and municipal data sharing protocols. These institutional frameworks establish infrastructural constraints that simultaneously enable and constrain technological innovation within planning practice (DiSalvo et al., 2017).

The adoption of CityGML-based 3D city models within municipal Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) represents the institutionalization of infrastructure - the process through which technical standards become embedded within organizational practices and regulatory frameworks (Star & Ruhleder, 1996). However, this institutionalization creates installed base inertia, where existing technical architectures resist integration with emerging technologies such as AR systems (Hanseth & Monteiro, 1997). The challenge is compounded by evolving climate policy requirements that demand real-time integration of building energy performance data with urban planning workflows, creating new functional requirements that existing systems were not designed to accommodate.

## Critical Analysis of Current AR Applications in Urban Contexts

These institutional constraints become particularly evident when examining how AR technologies have been deployed within urban planning contexts. A systematic examination of current AR implementations in urban planning reveals technology-practice misalignment - a fundamental disconnect between AR system capabilities and institutional requirements for professional planning practice (Orlikowski, 2007). Contemporary AR technologies, built on game engine frameworks such as Unreal Engine and Unity, prioritize visual fidelity, real-time performance, and user engagement over data integrity, semantic consistency, and institutional compliance (Barrile et al., 2024).

This misalignment manifests in architectural segregation between visualization and data management subsystems. Current implementations typically restrict AR technologies to presentation layer functions, maintaining a clear separation between immersive visualization capabilities and authoritative data editing operations (Kitchin, 2014). This segregation reflects deeper tensions between the "consumer technology" origins of AR platforms and the "enterprise data governance" requirements of urban planning institutions. The result is infrastructure inversion - situations where technological capabilities become constrained by institutional and data management requirements rather than enabling new forms of practice (Bowker & Star, 1999).

## Conceptual Framework: Bidirectional Data Synchronization as Socio-Technical Challenge

Addressing these fundamental misalignments requires moving beyond surface-level technological integration toward understanding the underlying socio-technical challenges. Implementing bidirectional data synchronization between AR interfaces and authoritative geodatabases represents a socio-technical system problem where technical solutions must simultaneously address institutional, organizational, and social requirements (Hughes, 1987). Current implementations exhibit digital infrastructure fragmentation, where disconnected technical components create systematic barriers to integrated workflows (Constantinides & Barrett, 2015).

From a technical perspective, this fragmentation manifests in temporal and semantic inconsistencies between frontend visualization states and backend data repositories. Modifications performed within AR environments - including geometric transformations, attribute updates, and feature creation operations - operate within isolated runtime contexts that lack persistent connection to authoritative data sources. Conversely, backend updates processed through traditional GIS workflows or automated data pipelines remain invisible to AR users until manual synchronization operations are performed. This creates information silos that fragment the decision-making process across multiple technological platforms (Kallinikos et al., 2013).

The emergence of open-source geospatial technologies, particularly CesiumJS for standards-compliant 3D visualization and WebXR for cross-platform AR interaction, creates new possibilities for addressing these challenges through generative mechanisms - technological frameworks that enable new forms of organizational practice (Hanseth & Lyytinen, 2010). However, realizing this potential requires developing boundary objects - technical artifacts that can operate effectively across multiple communities of practice while maintaining semantic integrity and institutional compliance (Star & Griesemer, 1989).

## Research Positioning and Theoretical Contributions

Building upon this conceptual foundation, this research operates at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) in spatial contexts, infrastructure studies, and urban planning theory. The work contributes to code/space theory - understanding how contemporary urban environments are increasingly constituted through software-mediated interactions that blur boundaries between digital and physical space (Kitchin & Dodge, 2011).

The research addresses a design science challenge: developing technological artifacts that solve identified problems within specific organizational contexts while contributing to broader theoretical understanding (Hevner et al., 2004). The proposed AR prototype serves as a technological instantiation that operationalizes bidirectional data synchronization concepts within real-world urban planning workflows (March & Smith, 1995).

Methodologically, the work employs a materialist approach to technology research, examining both AR system capabilities and their integration within institutional frameworks, data governance requirements, and professional practices (Orlikowski & Iacono, 2001). The Baden-Württemberg case studies provide a bounded context for empirical validation while ensuring findings relate to broader theoretical frameworks in digital planning and spatial information infrastructure (Yin, 2018).
